Parallels between animal training and machine learning

I've had an idea floating around in my head about the similarity been sifting around in my head for some time now
My interest in machine learning came about from the numerous examples from
namely the perceptron, independent component analysis
I see many parallels between my work in the lab and the

-animals learn different yet correlated features from the one you want them to train
-give example from work
-animals have to use reinforcement learning
