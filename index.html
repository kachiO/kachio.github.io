	<h1>Kachi O. </h1>
	<p> I am a neuroscientist and engineer, currently pursuing a PhD in Systems Neuroscience at 
		the <a href="http://churchlandlab.labsites.cshl.edu/">Churchland Lab</a> 
	 	in <a href="http://cshl.edu/">Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</a>. My research focuses on the roles of secondary visual areas 
		in visually-guided behaviors. I am fascinated by neuroscience-inspired deep learning approaches and I am ultimately interested
		in building the next generation of intelligent machines that augment human decision making, problem solving, and reasoning.
